# Music Bot

This is a Discord bot designed to play music in your Discord servers. It's a great addition to any music-loving community.

## What it Does

A project I created, designed to implement Discord's API and apply its "slash commands" to give this JS bot multiple functions.
Can play music from various sources and formats, such as YouTube, SoundCloud and online radio streams. 
It also has a range of commands and features to control the playback, such as playlists, queue function, skip, play/pause

## Built With

- Node.js - The runtime used
- Discord.js - The library used to interact with the Discord API
- JavaScript - all the commands to interact with the bot
